PDF Editor
============

I developed this PDF editor because I was dissatisfied with the ones available for free

------------
- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

Installation
------------
1. Clone the repository (or download the ZIP):
   git clone https://github.com/IhRafaell/PDF_editor.git

2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

How to Run
----------
1. Run the application:
   python app.py

2. Open your web browser and go to the link shown in the terminal. Usually something like:

You can choose multiple PDF files and join them, or you can choose images and make them PDFs
